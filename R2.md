# 100 Days Of Code - Log

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on May 29, Friday, 2020.

### Day 0: May 29, 2020 (Starting with the challenge.)

**Today's Progress:** I started with a freecodecamp video and using codepen.io to practice. I'm learning data types and about variables. 
PD: Previously I had already started to get a little familiar with JS.

**Thoughts:** It's my first day with this, GitHub. I learned to code recently, I started with HTML and that is helping me understand the basics of JavaScript. I feel a little anxious to have started.

### Day 1: May 30, 2020 (Learning variables.)

**Today's Progress:** It is important to have good practice when using variables and funcion names beacuse are case sensitive. Today I was reading all about that.

**Thoughts:** I think I made no much progress but I feel more calm  and confortable about my new challege. 

### Day 2: May 31, 2020 (Basic math operations.)

**Today's Progress:** I was learning to simplify basic operations. Using the aritmethic simbols plus equal. I just have to practice. Today I used freecodecamp.org

**Thoughts:** I have had a slowly day and todayÂ´s lesson was somewhat simple. 

### Day 3: June 01, 2020 (Quotes thing.)

**Today's Progress:** In JS it is important use correctly the single or double quote. I'm learning about context shapes wich is also included. Today I used freecodecamp.org

**Thoughts:** When I use freecodecamp, I have more exercises and I like it because sometimes I have mistakes and I learn from them.

### Day 4: June 02, 2020 (Backslash.)

**Today's Progress:** In JavaScript backslash is used for insert specific symbols in a string without JavaSacript misinterpreting what you mean. Using this it can add commands to fulfill functions.

**Thoughts:** Variables are broad and I'm at the beginning of the road. 

### Day 5: June 03, 2020 (Concatenating strings.)

**Today's Progress:** "+=" is used to combine two differents "sentences" and make it a function. And I'm learning to construct strings with variables.

**Thoughts:** I like when I can mixed functions in variables. I feel a litle anxious.

### Day 6: June 04, 2020 (Bracket notation I.)

**Today's Progress:** Now I'm learning about the function to use brackets notation to find character in a string.

**Thoughts:** Today I organized well and I was able to do more thngs in my day.

### Day 7: June 05, 2020 (Bracket notation II.)

**Today's Progress:** I'm not sure when I will use this function but now I know all about finding a specific digit in a string and change it when it is necessary. And I also know, how I can solve the length of a variable in the string.

**Thoughts:** I should practice the functions more to don't forget none.

### Day 8: June 06, 2020 (Arrays.)

**Today's Progress:** Now, using bracket I can store values in the same variable and adding one array inside another array.

**Thoughts:** I was feeling slow today, maybe I will feel better if I will sleep early.

### Day 9: June 07, 2020 (Indexes.)

**Today's Progress:** With JavaScript, It is can access the data inside the array using indexes whit bracket notation. Like strings, arrays use zero-based indexing, so the first element in an array has an index of 0.

**Thoughts:** Sometimes I have little energy and I try to distribute it in all my day. 

### Day 10: June 08, 2020 (Access array data with indexes.)

**Today's Progress:** Arrays can be identified using numbered indexes, this can be useful for the functions that I will learn little by little.

**Thoughts:** It was a heavy day, I feel a little tired, I was able to move forward anyway.

### Day 11: June 09, 2020 (Modify arrays with indexes.)

**Today's Progress:** It is possible to modify arrays using indexes with different data. It is like a sequence of orders to replace the firsts strings, always be careful with the spaces between the array name and the square brackets.

**Thoughts:** Also was a tired day but I like when I can practice with some examples. 

### Day 12: June 10, 2020 (Select an element using enumeration.)

**Today's Progress:** This lesson was about remembering how I can use matrices. In a sequence of arrays, each value has an enumeration and that helps to select one when needed in a function. 

**Thoughts:** I really didn't like matrices very much but now I'm learning something new and now I like it. / I enjoy being busy. I was organized some pending things.

### Day 13: June 11, 2020 (Push, pop, shift, and unshift.)

**Today's Progress:** Now I'm learning to manipulate arrays using push: add data to the end of an array; pop: extract and remove a value of the end of an array; shift: remove the first value of an array, and unshift: add data at the beginning of the array.

**Thoughts:** Another busy day, I really love it when I'm busy and forget everything else.

### Day 14: June 12, 2020 (Shopping list.)

**Today's Progress:** A shopping list can be created using sub-arrays. Sub-array has two element, the first element must contain a string with the name of the item and the second element must be a number.

**Thoughts:** Little angry day but with food, everything can be better.

### Day 15: June 13, 2020 (Invoke a function.)

**Today's Progress:** Inside the functions can be existed other functions named arguments. These functions have different elements to work together when invoked.

**Thoughts:** I feel this is a little more complicated, but nothing is impossible to learn.

### Day 16: June 14, 2020 (Global scope and functions.)

**Today's Progress:**  I'm learning about the correct use with the variables using "var" so that in a sequence of functions each one executes correctly.

**Thoughts:** 

### Day 17: June 15, 2020 (Local and global.)

**Today's Progress:** Now I'm learning local and global scope in functions to be careful when using them in variables.

**Thoughts:** It was a overloaded day.

### Day 18: June 16, 2020 ()

**Today's Progress:** I'm learning how I can return a value using the "return" function in different situations. It can be used with multiple arguments in variables to solve it.
