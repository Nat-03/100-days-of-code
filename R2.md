# 100 Days Of Code - Log

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on May 29, Friday, 2020.

**Today's Progress:** I started with a freecodecamp video and using codepen.io to practice. I'm learning data types and about variables. 
PD: Previously I had already started to get a little familiar with JS.

### Day 1: May 30, 2020 (Learning variables)

**Today's Progress:** It is important to have good practice when using variables and funcion names beacuse are case sensitive. Today I was reading all about that.

### Day 2: May 31, 2020 (Basic math operations)

**Today's Progress:** I was learning to simplify basic operations. Using the aritmethic simbols plus equal. I just have to practice.
