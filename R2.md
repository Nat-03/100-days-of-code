# 100 Days Of Code - Log

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on May 29, Friday, 2020.

### Day 0: May 29, 2020 (Starting with the challenge)

**Today's Progress:** I started with a freecodecamp video and using codepen.io to practice. I'm learning data types and about variables. 
PD: Previously I had already started to get a little familiar with JS.

**Thoughts:** It's my first day with this, GitHub. I learned to code recently, I started with HTML and that is helping me understand the basics of JavaScript. I feel a little anxious to have started.

### Day 1: May 30, 2020 (Learning variables)

**Today's Progress:** It is important to have good practice when using variables and funcion names beacuse are case sensitive. Today I was reading all about that.

**Thoughts:** I think I made no much progress but I feel more calm  and confortable about my new challege. 

### Day 2: May 31, 2020 (Basic math operations)

**Today's Progress:** I was learning to simplify basic operations. Using the aritmethic simbols plus equal. I just have to practice. Today I used freecodecamp.org

**Thoughts:** I have had a slowly day and todayÂ´s lesson was somewhat simple. 

### Day 3: June 01, 2020 (Quotes thing)

**Today's Progress:** In JS it is important use correctly the single or double quote. I'm learning about context shapes wich is also included. Today I used freecodecamp.org

**Thoughts:** When I use freecodecamp, I have more exercises and I like it because sometimes I have mistakes and I learn from them.

### Day 4: June 02, 2020 (Backslash)

**Today's Progress:** In JavaScript backslash is used for insert specific symbols in a string without JavaSacript misinterpreting what you mean. Using this it can add commands to fulfill functions.

**Thoughts:** Variables are broad and I'm at the beginning of the road. 

### Day 5: June 03, 2020 (concatenating strings)

**Today's Progress:** "+=" is used to combine two differents "sentences" and make it a function. And I'm learning to construct strings with variables.

**Thoughts:** I like when I can mixed functions in variables. I feel a litle anxious.

### Day 6: June 04, 2020 ()

**Today's Progress:** 

**Thoughts:**
